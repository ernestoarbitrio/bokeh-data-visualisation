    "Datashader is a graphics pipeline system for creating meaningful representations of large datasets quickly and flexibly. Datashader breaks the creation of images into a series of explicit steps that allow computations to be done on intermediate representations. This approach allows accurate and effective visualizations to be produced automatically without trial-and-error parameter tuning, and also makes it simple for data scientists to focus on particular data and relationships of interest in a principled way.\n",
    "\n",
    "The computation-intensive steps in this process are written in Python but transparently compiled to machine code using Numba and flexibly distributed across cores and processors using Dask , providing a highly optimized rendering pipeline that makes it practical to work with extremely large datasets even on standard hardware.\n",
